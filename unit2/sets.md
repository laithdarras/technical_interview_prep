# Sets

Sets are **unordered collections of unique elements**. They are powerful for fast lookup times and set operations.

## Use Cases:
- Removing duplicates
- Checking existence of a value
- Performing set math (union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference)

## Properties:
- Unordered
- Mutable
- No duplicates
- Fast access: **O(1)** average lookup time

---

## When to Use:

| Goal                                | Best Structure |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| Maintain order                      | List           |
| Key-value mapping                   | Dictionary     |
| Enforce uniqueness + fast lookup    | Set            |

# Using AI Tools (Intelligently)

AI is a great companion when used as a **thinking partner**, not a crutch.

---

## Ways I Use AI:
- Start with a **brute-force solution**, then use AI to suggest optimizations
- Use it to **unblock myself**, not to hand me full answers
- Generate **mock interview questions** (technical + behavioral)
- Break down logic or improve clarity
- Help evaluate **time/space complexity**

---

## Example Workflow:
1. Solve on your own → explain your logic
2. Ask AI: "How can I optimize this?"
3. Use AI's feedback to build intuition, not just copy it

---

## Be Careful:
- AI can give wrong answers at times
- Always verify logic and edge cases
- Think critically before accepting suggestions

Use it like an interviewer — someone who nudges you, not someone who codes for you.
